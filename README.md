# helooo :D

ðŸ”º I'm a 16 year *(self-proclaimed)* developer. I like to make ***blazingly fast*** websites but I do also enjoy *game development* and *desktop app development*. 

ðŸ”» Although I prefer *backend work*, I do like working with UI (though i dont enjoy creating a design from scratch). 

ðŸ”¹I'm quite proficient in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript** and **NodeJS**.  
ðŸ”¸I'm also quite competent in **C#**, **Java** (a bit rusty on the last one)  
ðŸ”¹Currently learning **C++** to try and make a (very humble and miniscule) game engine!  

Don't question my work, I 100% know what I'm doing ðŸ˜Œ (I don't).
