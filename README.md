I'm a 16 year *(self-proclaimed)* developer. I like to make ***blazingly fast*** websites but I do also enjoy *game development* and *desktop app development*. 

Although I prefer *backend work*, I do like making UI (though i dont enjoy creating a design from scratch). 

I Work with **JavaScript** (usually **typescript**) and **C#** the most *though I know a fair bit of **Java** and **Python***

Don't question my work, I 100% know what I'm doing (I don't).
